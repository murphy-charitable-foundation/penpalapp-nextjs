                    Since its establishment in 2018, Murphy Charitable Foundation Uganda has made a significant impact on the lives of over 10,000 impoverished individuals in East-Northern Uganda. Through a diverse range of programs, including pen pal initiatives, women empowerment, youth empowerment, cancer awareness, child sponsorship, entrepreneurship, community outreaches, capacity building, mentoring, and community research on poverty levels in families, our organization has worked tirelessly to serve our communities and improve their well-being.

                    In addition to our existing programs, we also actively engage with local schools and hospitals. We recognize the importance of education and healthcare in creating a better future for the communities we serve. We visit schools to provide educational support, including supplies, resources, and mentorship opportunities to students. By doing so, we aim to enhance learning experiences and encourage academic achievement.

                    Our organizationâ€™s commitment to humanitarian work has brought about lasting change in the project areas across Uganda. We extend our support to disadvantaged individuals without discrimination based on race or religion, firmly believing that every person in need deserves a helping hand. By implementing these programs, we aim to uplift communities and create sustainable solutions to the challenges they face.
